This is against Discord TermsOfService and you can be banned for this. Use it at your own risk. 
## The empty file 'token' is necessary for the app to work. The app writes the token in it so that you dont have to paste it again and again. In case you want to change and use a different token, empty the 'token' file and paste the new token in the 'token' file. Token resets everytime you change your discord password.
## Note: The token is not Bot token. You have to enter your user token.
## Dont know your user token???
## Dont worry :)
Open DevTools by right clicking -> Inspect -> Now in the panel opened, Find "Application" (Must be somewhere at the top) ->
Then click Those Device-Mobile icon, must be somewhere in the start of the line where you found "Application" -> Now find LocalStorage.
Now double click It. Something more, something new must have appeared below it. There, double click discord.com.
There must be many KEYS and VALUES visible now.
Then in filter search box above those, type token and search.
Copy token value.
This is your self bot token. This is Dangerous to share until you trust the person
. because they can use this to DO ANYTHING WITH YOU ACCOUNT!
they can send messages, and (maybe) even login to Your account!
## If you still had problems getting the token, watch one of the plenty videos on youtube or wherever you want telling how to get the self user token!

## TO GET THE CHANNEL ID
Enable Developer mode on discord. 
To do it, open your discord user settings. Now find "Behaviour"
Here enable it.
Now go to any server where you want to spam those money messages.
I recommend your own server, or the other server will surely ban or mute you. Followingly,Discord might ban you too.
Click on the channel where you want to send commands. To do it, right click it and click "Copy Id'. If you are on touchscreen, press and hold the channel.
